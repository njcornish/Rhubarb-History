# Introduction

Rhubarb before the late 18th century was known and defined principally by its root and medical usage which left the form of the plant itself surprisingly elusive. Illustrations of the plant between 1554 and 1680 provide a good case study of a plant which was known only partially to Western physicians and apothecaries. Because the root was a valuable one [^1] if it could be grown at a high standard there was the possibility of high profit as well as the respect that would come with introducing the new plant.  Within the Roman influenced ideas about the regulation of the Body’s elements, digestive regulation was considered vital, and rhubarb roots were the mildest and least unpleasant purgative drug at the time. This meant that they occupied a position as a go-to home remedy for all sorts of illness. Within a combination of poor diet and traditional purgative practice as a treatment model, rhubarb could be described as a sort of contemporary cross between a weetabix and an aspirin. The highest quality root was traded from Northern China through the Russian Tsar’s monopoly from 1682 to the mid 1700s without its accompanying stem and leaves. This left a gap in Western botanical understanding where there is clearly a plant to be found, described as early as Dioscorides' De Materia Medica (circa 60AD)[^2] but there is only the root and its effects to mark it out from other plants. It should also be stressed at this point that the rhubarb we are talking about here is a whole family of plants which by the late 18th century had cross-pollinated into the more recognisable culinary plant which is more well known today. The plant they were looking for can be seen to the right. The distinguishing features are the thick root with a familiar big lower leaf section, the bolting stem that grows after this part with a papery coating on the stem, and the dense flowering sections which emerge at the top. Here, we will trace illustrations of rhubarb from Morrison back through the botanical works of Parkinson, Alpini, Gerard, and back to Mattiolus. We will see the process of illustration creation across a century and a half as Western botanical canon struggled to adapt to partially known plants.

# Rhubarb in Morrison's Historia Plantarum Oxoniensis

Morrison’s Historia Plantarum Oxoniensis [^3] in 1780, the first scientific work published by Oxford University press, promised a new beginning for Early Modern Botany. The aim was to provide a completely illustrated guide to all known plants. By then, natural philosophy’s influence on botany had promoted the construction of systemic relations between species. While previous herbals were orientated around function, and rhubarbs defined principally by their medicinal value, Morrison tried to construct a system based around plants with similar seeds. As it happens, Rhubarb and its relatives have quite a distinctive triangular seed, although they are not unique in this characteristic. The book’s ambition was to redo the illustrations and produce a clean break with the haphazard botanical tradition through a complete account of clear examples. The prototype publication (the section on carrots) lived up to this with beautiful and meticulous illustrations but expense and time led to corners being cut in the later edition. It is clear that the illustrators were working at this point from Johnson’s edition of Gerrard's Herball and were taking a shortcut to save time and money. This led to simplification and the shrinking of bigger images to fit whole families onto one page. Morrison’s Historia was meant to be a clean break into a new period of botany but could not escape an intimate connection with the tradition of herbal illustration because of the gargantuan effort and resources it would take to do so. The image of rhubarb here is connected closely to the illustrative traditions the book was trying to supplant. In tracing its origin we will see how western botanists dealt with plants which did not fit their systems or which were only partially known, as well as the process of reproduction and change of illustrations.

# Origins in Johnson's edition of Gerard

The picture, contrary to the promises of Morrison, was directly copied from the 1733 edition of John Gerard’s 1597 herbal [^4]. This edition was edited by Thomas Johnson, who kept most of the illustrations but changed the rhubarb picture citing both John Parkinson and Prospero Alpini. The image here does not look like it was taken from a real plant. It is more likely to be a heavily simplified version of Parkinson's which will be seen next. It maintains the leaf shape and the root with its shoots anachronistically depicted at the base of a plant that’s already grown.  In particular the roots are very odd, with little definition and a shallow wide shape which does not seem to have much precedant. I would like to suggest that this comes from a combination of poor detail in simplifying Parkinson’s illustration which we will examine next and from a desire to represent the large root which was traded across Europe despite the plants grown themselves producing a different one. The midsection of the plant is accurate, with sensibly shaped leaves, but the flowers are highly simplified and spread out, both for clarity and for ease of carving. The image in Morrison’s work is a simplified version of the heavily abridged original, probably due to speed and the reduced size of the image. The characteristic sleeve around the stem is less detailed and the shading much more simple. In addition to this, the veins in the leaves are simplified into an easier pattern. It is interesting that in taking a woodcut image and turning it into a copper etching the detail is lessened, though this is probably more to do with size than the limits of the medium.

# Parkinson's Rhubarb

                          
John Parkinson’s illustration of rhubarb [^5] is the closest example from which this illustration might have been taken. His illustration does a lot more to accommodate the information from his possession of the root to the plant he has grown. He criticizes the earlier illustration of Mattiolus as ‘imagined’ and his most contemporary example (Alpini’s) as ‘taken from the soil too early’. This image is the most rhubarb-like of all the ones explored here, and seems to have been done from experience of a real plant. It combines the beginnings of growth from the root with fully grown lower leaves and a flowering stem which suggests an amalgamation of several plants or stages of growth. Parkinson has nonetheless had trouble ‘accommodating the root’ and has attached a different drawing of one to the base of the plant. He acknowledges that the root this plant has produced is not the one traded across Europe. He blames this on its cultivation and England’s climate rather than challenge the plant itself. Because he has a reputational stake in the plant, and the authority of Alpini, it is simpler and easier to explain that the plant just does not grow very well outside its natural habitat.

# Alpini's Rhubarb 


Prospero Alpini, who ran the university gardens at Padua in the early 17th century, was very interested in rhubarb and not only explored a new plant contender but also illustrated it. He wrote an account of a ‘rhubarb dispute’ at the university in 1613 [^6] in which he argued successfully (in that he won over the crowd) that the plant he had was the one which was briefly mentioned in the account of Dioscorides. This is a good example of how knowledge was verified and categorised in these institutions at the time. It seems likely that Alpini did have some sort of new plant, and a rhubarb at that, because John Parkinson validates his own claim to ‘true rhubarb’ by his having received it from Alpini through a ‘Dr Lister’. Alpini’s rhubarb illustration [^7] looks much more like rhubarb, but the roots and the stem are completely wrong. The roots are too small and the way the lower leaves emerge from the stem is inaccurate. This looks more like a member of the daisy family which was also eaten at the time. This may have been confused by the illustrator or somewhere along the line swapped in for the original.

# Original Gerrard

John Gerard’s ‘Greate Herball’ of 1597 was essentially an english copy of Rembert Dodoens’ ‘Cruytebook’ but his publishers apparently thought that copying the pictures from that (which was only sparsely illustrated anyway) might suggest more plagiarism than they were willing to admit to. They used the supply of woodcuts made by Mattiolus and passed through several german publications to illustrate this work, which became very popular since it was in english. Gerrard reused both rhubarb pictures, but categorised them as two different plants, with the root based plant listed as ‘bastard rhubarb’ because he maintained that it can be used for a ‘purging’ treatment. What defines it as a rhubarb is its medicinal purpose, which creates an odd family of different plants listed which all identify with purgation. He cites the taller illustration and describes it ‘since there is extant a picture of the greene rhubarbe’. Gerrard is usually seen as writing his book and attaching the illustrations haphazardly later, but here he has done the opposite because the plant is unknown to him in real life. This provides an example of how taking images from other books without actual experience of the plant gave rise to misunderstandings and the perpetuation of mistakes.

# Mattiolus

Mattiolus in 1544 wrote a commentary on the botanical work of Dioscorides [^8], for which he coordinated the creation of a large number of woodcuts. These included an image which was labelled as rhubarb, and is the same as the one used in Gerard's original herball.  The illustration shows an obviously unsatisfactory root, clearly different to the drawn root shown in later images, with a plant that is distinctly not rhubarb. It's leaves, and stem are completely different to the real plant. Mattiolus’ woodcuts became the basis of a commonly used collection of botanical images which were appropriated by later writers as the standard images. Many of the other docks on the same page as rhubarb are represented by copies of the original Mattiolus illustrations, passed down for 150 years through several works. Several of them appear in Gerrard, and consequently in Morison's book on the same page as the revised rhubarb image.

# Mattiolus revived in Boym's illustrated plants of China

Though it is possible to make this process appear linear, and there is a direct lineage of illustrations from Mattiolus to Morrison, it is not that simple. The Jesuit Missionary Michel Boym in travelled across China from 1643 to 1652 and published his 'flora sinensis' [^9] (chinese flora) which depicted both animals and plants in 1656. His image of Rhubarb looks very similar to the second of Mattiolus' prints. This was later coloured in after publication. The most likely scenario here is that a seleciton bias occured as Boym may have seen the Mattiolus illustration and gone out to find that plant, depicting some sort of flowering cabbage instead. It is important to note therefore that this process was still quite fluid and older illustrations continued to be used even when new ones were available. Strikingly, the roots depicted here are very small and obviously not those which were traded to the West. This suggests that Boym's interest in rhubarb comes from a perspective of botany rather than medicine because from the latter viewpoint the primary characteristic of rhubarb is the purgative root.

# Conclusion
                            
It is clear that Morrison's claims to originality in his images are false, and that the roots of his work are much more entangled with a heritage of herbal publications than he would like to admit. Nontheless, the most interesting part of this is the way illustrations from across Europe, Mattiolus in Germany, Alpini in Italy, and Parkinson in England, were part of a fragile discourse which in this case tried (with various levels of success) to deal with gaps in botanical knowledge. Rhubarb is a good example of a partially known plant, and with this knowledge, we can see how the relationship between the large roots which could be bought and the smaller plants which could be grown produced a conflict in the illustrations. As a case study, this could be compared with other partially known plants such as chichona bark, to explore further how Early Modern Botanists dealt with the gaps in their knowledge.
